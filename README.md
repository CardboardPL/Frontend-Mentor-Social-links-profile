## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the usage of the address tag and how to utilize the :focus-within pseudo class so that if a child of an element is being selected it will update the parent element.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as an inspiration for my future projects

### Useful resources

- [MDN's article about the :focus-within Pseudo Class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within) - This helped me by letting me know how to utilize the pseudo class and figure out how to select the parent element when one of its children is being selected.
